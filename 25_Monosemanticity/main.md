- Antropic, 2023

## Monosemanticity
Monosemanticity refers to the property of a component (e.g., a neuron or a feature) in a model having a single, clear, and interpretable meaning or functionality. A monosemantic component responds consistently to one type of input or encodes one specific concept, making it easier to understand and predict its behavior.
