# Introduction
- X-former is a term often used as shorthand for transformer
- The vanilla transformer has improved over time for:
  - Improved model efficiency - Computation and memory
  - Model Generalization
  - Model Adaptation - On other tasks

# Vanilla Transformer
- The vanilla Transformer is a sequence-to-sequence model and consists of an encoder and a decoder, each of which is a stack of N identical blocks.
- Each encoder block is mainly composed of a multi-head self-attention module and a position-wise feed-forward network (FFN). 
- For building a deeper model, a residual connection is employed around each module, followed by Layer Normalization module. 
- Compared to the encoder blocks, decoder blocks additionally insert cross-attention modules between the multi-head self-attention modules and the position-wise FFNs. 
- Furthermore, the self-attention modules in the decoder are adapted to prevent each position from attending to subsequent positions. 

# Types of Transformers
Three types of transformers:
1. Encoder only transformer
2. Decoder only transformer
3. Encoder-Decoder transformer

# Attention
Three types of attention:
1. Self-attention - in encoder to learn about input
2. Masked self-attention - in decoder(at the start) to do self-attention wihout looking into the future tokens(helpful in training)
3. Cross-attention - Uses encoder's Q and K with decoder's V matrix to decide attention values.

# Inductive bias
- Transformer is often compared against convolutional and recurrent networks.
- Convolutional networks are known to impose the inductive biases of translation invariance and locality with shared local kernel functions.
- Similarly, recurrent networks carry the inductive biases of temporal invariance and locality via their Markovian structure.
- On the other hand, the Transformer architecture makes few assumptions about structural information of data. 
This makes Transformer a universal and flexible architecture. 
As a side effect, the lack of structural bias makes Transformer prone to overfitting for small-scale data.
