# Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures, 2001
## Leo Breiman

Abstract. There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commit- ment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob- lems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in ﬁelds outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a ﬁeld is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.


There are two reasons for performing statistics:
1. To be able to predict future data
2. To learn something valuable about the current data

These two leads to two different cultures:
1. The Data Modeling Culture: The analysis in this culture starts with assuming a stochastic data model for the inside of the black box.
2. The Algorithmic Modeling Culture:
