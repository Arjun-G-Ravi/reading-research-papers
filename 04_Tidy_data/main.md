# Tidy Data

### - Hadley Wickham

- Effort in data analysis is often heavily focused on cleaning and preparing data and little research exists on optimizing data cleaning processes.
- This paper focuses on one aspect of data cleaning called "data tidying," which involves structuring datasets for easy manipulation, modeling, and visualization. 
- The standard structure of a tidy dataset is defined:
`Each variable corresponds to a column, each observation corresponds to a row, and each type of observational unit corresponds to a separate table. This standardized structure simplifies data manipulation, modeling, and visualization tasks.`

The paper emphasizes the importance of structuring datasets in a tidy format to simplify data analysis tasks and facilitate tool development. By adhering to tidy data principles, researchers can streamline the data cleaning process and focus on the substantive aspects of their analysis.
