`By studying the connections between neurons, we can find meaningful algorithms in the weights of neural networks.`

# Introduction
- Most interpretability research focuses on understanding what a NN as a whole is trying to do
- In these papers, the researchers try to understand the working of individual neurons in a NN, by spending time tracing throught the connections between neurons.
- The researchers found that the weights of a NN can be interpreted as a circuit, which is a sequence of operations that transform input data into output data.
- In contrast to the typical picture of neural networks as a black box, we’ve been surprised how approachable the network is on this scale.

# Three Speculative Claims about Neural Networks

## Claim 1: Features
- Features are the fundamental unit of neural networks. They correspond to directions (in a vector space)
- Early layers contain features like edge or curve detectors, while later layers have features like floppy ear detectors or wheel detectors.

Curve detectors
- The paper claim that they exist
- 
## Claim 2: Circuits
- A “circuit” is a computational subgraph of a neural network. It consists of a set of features, and the weighted edges that go between them in the original network.
- 
## Claim 3: Universality
-  Analogous features and circuits form across models and tasks.
