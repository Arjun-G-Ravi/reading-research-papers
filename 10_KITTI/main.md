# What problem is the paper trying to solve?
The paper "KITTI-360: A Novel Dataset and Benchmarks for Urban Scene Understanding in 2D and 3D" by Liao et al. (2020) [1] addresses the lack of large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets for urban scene understanding in both 2D and 3D. The authors argue that existing datasets are limited in terms of size, variability, and annotation quality, which hinders the development of robust and accurate urban scene understanding models.

# What is the key invention/research in the paper, to solve that problem?
The key contribution of this paper is the introduction of the KITTI-360 dataset, a large-scale, diverse, and richly annotated dataset for urban scene understanding in both 2D and 3D.
